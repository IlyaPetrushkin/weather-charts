            Details. The app should use routing, at least 2 routes must be implemented. One of the routes
            should be a page containing dashboards with charts. On the page with the dashboards, a user
            should be able to display 1-4 charts. Moreover, it should be possible to filter the charts by dates
            and to display them accordingly.
            The second route may contain the implementation of other parts of the functionality at your
            discretion.
            UI must be responsive. You should use Vuetify.
            Each chart should be configurable:
            1) Type of the chart: line or bar
            2) Line/Fill colour
            The data for the charts could be either randomly generated or fetched via any public API.
            Bonus points for you if you will use composition api.
            Example. ​There​ ​are​ ​N​ ​sensors,​ ​some​ ​of​ ​them​ ​measure​ ​temperature,​ ​some​ ​-​​humidity,​​some​​-​
            ​light.​ ​It should be possible ​to display​ ​the​ ​data​ ​on​ ​different​ ​charts.​ ​At the same time, the app
            should be able to ​combine the data from several sensors. For instance​, it could get the
            ​temperature​​from​​2​​sensors​, ​humidity from another one, so that​all the aggregated data would
            be displayed on 1 chart.
            Libraries​​that​​could​​be​​used:
            —​​Vuetify
            — Nuxt.js
            — Vuex ORM
            —​Highcharts​​or​any other analogue
            — Any other library of your choice"
